# P5RStringEditor
Manage edited strings and descriptions for your P5R modding project

# What is this?
This is a program that allows you to edit NAME.TBL values using a GUI, paired with editable description text.  
Also imports/exports FTDs so you can edit NPC names, Field names etc.

# Features
- You can save/load the state of your edits as JSON
- You can export TBL/BMD/FTD to a folder stucture that mimics a Reloaded II mod
- You can narrow down entries by section and search by name with CTRL + F
- Edits should work with both P5R Vanilla and DeathChaos's P5RCBT mod

I might add support for P5 PS3 at some point in the future.
