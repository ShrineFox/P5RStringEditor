# P5RStringEditor
Manage edited strings and descriptions for your P5R modding project

# What is this?
This is a program that allows you to edit NAME.TBL values using a GUI, paired with editable description text.

# Features
- You can save/load the state of your edits as JSON
- You can export TBL and BMD (or optionally just MSG) to a folder stucture that mimics a Reloaded II mod
- You can narrow down entries by TBL section and search by name with CTRL + F
- Edits should work with both P5R Vanilla and DeathChaos's P5RCBT mod

# Future Plans
I might add support for P5 PS3 at some point in the future, or maybe editing other string tables such as FTD files.
